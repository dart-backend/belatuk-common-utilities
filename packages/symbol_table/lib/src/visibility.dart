/// [Visibility] instances can be compared using the `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` operators.
/// The evaluation of the aforementioned operators is logical;
/// for example, a [private] symbol is *less visible* than a [public] symbol,
/// so [private] < [public].

/// In a nutshell: [private] < [protected] < [public].
